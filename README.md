Where is cryptography being used?

## Integrity

Hash checks are used for data integrity checks.
A good hash function is a function that its hard to find a collision for.

## Authenticity

## Secrecy

# Terminology

Cryptography - "Secret Writing": Enciphering and deciphering of messages.

Cryptanalysis - Trying to break the code.

Plaintext: A message in it's original form.

Ciphertext: A message in encoded form.

Encryption: The process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext.
Decryption: The process of transforming ciphertext into plaintext.

Cipher: A method used for encryption.

# Ciper

## Shift Cipher

### Ceasar cipher (ROT13)

A very basic substitution cipher that rotates all characters by 13 positions.

## Substitution cipher

## Poly-alphabetic (Vigen√®re) cipher

(Makes frequency analysis much more difficult)
